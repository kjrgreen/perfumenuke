# PERFUMENUKE
An open-source perfume formulation tool and material database

# HOW TO USE

- Open the tool in your web browser: https://nuke-haus.github.io/perfumenuke/
- On the formula page you can load formulas from the database and modify them or create new ones. The information display below the formula editor will automatically update to reflect any changes made in the editor.
- On the database page you can import and export material, mixture and formula data. Use the material and mixture editors to load existing data and modify it, or create new materials and mixtures.
- Be sure to save your work and export it when you're finished using the tool, as it will not save your work between sessions. 

# WISHLIST

These are features and other things i'd like to eventually have in this tool.

- I may try and add some sort of caching system in the future so the tool remembers your previous sessions.
- Desperately need to expand the material and mixture database some more.
- Maybe some sort of graph visualizers on the formula page.
